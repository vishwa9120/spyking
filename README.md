This Python script is a basic keylogger designed to capture and record all keyboard activity on a system. It uses the pynput library to listen for keypress events and stores them in a log. Every 15 seconds, the log data is sent to a Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API, allowing remote monitoring of the captured keystrokes in real-time. 
🔧 Main Features:
Captures all keyboard inputs, including special keys like Enter, Space, etc.

Uses threading to run a background reporter that sends logs every 15 seconds.

Sends data securely via HTTP POST requests to a specified Telegram chat.

Runs continuously and invisibly in the background.

📦 Technologies Used:
pynput: For detecting and recording keypresses.

requests: To send HTTP POST requests to the Telegram Bot API.

threading: To handle background execution without blocking keyboard capture.
