# spyking
This Python script is a basic keylogger designed to capture and record all keyboard activity on a system. It uses the pynput library to listen for keypress events and stores them in a log. Every 15 seconds, the log data is sent to a Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API, allowing remote monitoring of the captured keystrokes in real-time.
